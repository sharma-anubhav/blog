My name is Anubhav Sharma. I am a Final-year Computer Engineering undergraduate and a budding researcher at Thapar Institute of Technology in India. I have benefited from the comprehensive exposure to the core areas of Computer Science as provided by my university, having gained proficiency in Python, C, and C++, and have also completed courses in Operating Systems, Database Management, Data structures and Algorithms, among others.
I am constantly working on new things which are posted here on this blog.
