<br>
Looking at him I see the pain,<br>
I see the scars that still remain.<br>
I see things that were never told,<br>
Buried inside him that grew old.<br>
<br>
Looking deep into his eyes,<br>
I see the childhood cries.<br>
I see the guilt no one ever knew,<br>
With time that only grew.<br>
<br>
Looking at him I see straight through his lies,<br>
I see a light inside that never dies.<br>
I listen even when he doesn't speak,<br>
I see the strength even when he is weak.<br>
<br>
Looking at him I see love disguised,<br>
I feel the heart beating inside.<br>
I remember the times he wants to forget,<br>
As slowly through the eyes a tear beget.<br>
<br>
Looking at him I see a friend<br>
That's been with me since the beginning<br>
And will be with me till the end.<br>
<br>
I am looking at a mirror on the wall.<br>
