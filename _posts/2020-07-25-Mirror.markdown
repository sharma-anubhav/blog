Looking deep into his eyes<br>
I see all the childhood cries.<br>
I see all the guilt that no one ever knew<br>
With time that only grew.<br>
<br>
Looking at him I see straight through his lies<br>
I see a light inside that never dies.<br>
I listen even when he doesn't speak<br>
I see the strength even when he is weak.<br>
<br>
Looking at him I see love disguised,<br>
I feel the heart beating inside.<br>
I remember the times he wants to forget,<br>
As slowly through the eyes a tear beget.<br>
<br>
Looking at him I see a friend<br>
That's been with me since the beginning<br>
And will be with me till the end.<br>
<br>
I am looking at a mirror on the wall....
