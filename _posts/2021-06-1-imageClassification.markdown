#INTRODUCTION
<b>Machine learning<b> is an application of artificial intelligence, which allows the computer to operate in a self-learning mode, without being explicitly programmed. It is a very interesting and complex topic, which could drive the future of technology.
There are copious applications of Machine learning, out of which Image Classification is one. To classify images, here we are using SVM.<br><br>

## Classification
The task of identifying what an image represents is called image classification. An image classification model is trained to recognize various classes of images. For example, you may train a model to recognize photos representing two different types of animals: Dogs or Cats <br>

## Suppoet Vector Machine (SVM)
SVM is a supervised machine learning algorithm which can be used for classification or regression problems. It uses a technique called the kernel trick to transform your data and then based on these transformations it finds an optimal boundary between the possible outputs. Simply put, it does some extremely complex data transformations, then figures out how to seperate your data based on the labels or outputs you've defined.<br>
